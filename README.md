Kyle's Login UI Mockup for Bay Valley Tech

Login-UI Project Instructions

The goal of this project is to use HTML, CSS, and the flexbox module in CSS to create a simple Login User Interface.  You may make multiple drafts of the login page of your own designs, but at least one of your drafts should look like the example photo provided below.


This project does not need to be a working login page (with working username and password authentication). 
 
This project should just be an HTML and CSS file, no JavaScript will be required.

Step 1: Create a project folder named  firstname-lastname-login-ui-project 
-You should write your actual name instead of literally "firstname" "lastname"

Step 2: Create an HTML5 file named login.html inside your project folder

Step 3: Create a CSS file named login-styles.css inside your project folder

Step 4: Link your CSS file to your HTML file inside the <head></head> element using a <link> element, with the href attribute set to login-styles.css. 
Example: <link rel="stylesheet" href="login-styles.css">

Step 5: Your <title> element should be titled :  <title>"Yourname"'s Login UI Project</title>

Step 6: Create a code repository on github.com.
Your GitHub.com repo should be in kebab-case and following the naming convention:
firstname-lastname-login-ui-project

You must Create an HTML and CSS project that meets the following requirements:

REQUIREMENTS:
The login box must be centered in the screen and stay in the center of the screen even as you resize the web-browser window.
You must use flexbox properties to achieve this, not margin, padding, or position.
The login box should have a minimum size, and the input fields or text in the box should not leak out of the box.
The login box should have box-shadow and rounded edges.
The login box should have a username and password input field, with placeholder text like in the photo.
The text entered into the password field must be hidden (with asterisks or circles)
The login box should have a button.

EXTRA CREDIT AND PRACTICE:
